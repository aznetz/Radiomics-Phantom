-Description: 
1.   This method is to compute neighborhood intensity difference matrix(NIDM) from image inside
      the binary mask. The neighborhood is in 3D.  All the feature calculation is done the same as NeighborIntensityDifference25 does. 
2.   NIDM is passed into NeighborIntensityDifference3_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1.  NHood: The neighborhood matrix size in X dimension.
2.  NHoodSym: 1==neighborhood matrix size in Y and Z are calculated to best match neighborhood physical length in X dimension.
                       0==neighborhood matrx size are same in X, Y, and Z dimensions.
3.   IncludeEdge: Include edge pixels for analysis (1) or not (0).
4.   RangeMin:   Minimum intensity value for analysis.
5.   RangeMax:   Maximum intensity value for analysis.
6.   NBins:       The number of bins.
RangeMin, RangeMax, NBins are used to reduce the number of interested intensity level.
