-Description: 
1.   This method is to compute histogram from image inside the binary mask.
2.   Histogram is passed into IntensityHistogram_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1. NBins:          The number of bins.
2. RangeMin:    Lower bound of bin location.
3. RangeMax:   Upper bound of bin location.
4. RangeFix:     1==The specified RangeMin and RangeMax specified are used. 0==Ignore the specified RangeMin and RangeMax, and 
                    RangeMin and RangeMax are dynamically determined by min and max of the current image.
5. OnlyUseMaxSlice:  1: Binary mask only contains the binary slice with the maximum area. 0: Use the binary mask as it is.

-Revision:
2014-02-06: The method is implemented.
