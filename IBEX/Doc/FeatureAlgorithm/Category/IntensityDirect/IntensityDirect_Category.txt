-Description: 
1. This method is to preprocess the binary mask for the features derived directly from the image intensity.
    The binary mask can be modified through the intensity thresholding, the binary erosion, 
    and/or using only the binary slice with the maximum area.
2.  Image and binary mask are passed into IntensityDirect_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1. ThresholdLow:   Lower threshold of image intensity.
2. ThresholdHigh:  Upper threshold of image intensity.
3. ErosionDist:       Distance in mm for binary mask erosion.
4. OnlyUseMaxSlice:  1==Binary mask only contains the binary slice with the maximum area. 0==Use the binary mask as it is.


-Revision:
2014-01-01: The method is implemented.
