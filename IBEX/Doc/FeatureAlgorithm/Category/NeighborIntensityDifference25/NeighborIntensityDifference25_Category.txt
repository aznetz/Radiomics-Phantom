-Description: 
1.   This method is to compute neighborhood intensity difference matrix(NIDM) from image inside
      the binary mask. The neighborhood is in 2D.  Intensity difference is computed in 2D
      neighborhood. All the feature calculation is done the same as NeighborIntensityDifference3 does. 
2.   NIDM is passed into NeighborIntensityDifference25_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1.  NHood: The neighborhood matrix size in X dimension.
2.  NHoodSym: 1==neighborhood matrix size in Y are calculated to best match neighborhood physical length in X dimension.
                       0==neighborhood matrx size are same in X and Y dimensions.
3.   IncludeEdge: Include edge pixels for analysis (1) or not (0).
4.  AdaptLimitLevel: If AdaptLimitLevel=1, ignore parameters RangeMin, RangeMax, and NBins. Range set to the minimum(MinValue) and
     maximum(MaxValue) of the masked image. NBins is length(MinValue:MaxValue). If RoundtoNearest is used for preprocessing, 
     Nbins = length(MinValue:Value:MaxValue) where value is from the parameter for RoundtoNearest.
5.   RangeMin:   Minimum intensity value for analysis.
6.   RangeMax:   Maximum intensity value for analysis.
7.   NBins:       The number of bins.
RangeMin, RangeMax, NBins are used to reduce the number of interested intensity level.
