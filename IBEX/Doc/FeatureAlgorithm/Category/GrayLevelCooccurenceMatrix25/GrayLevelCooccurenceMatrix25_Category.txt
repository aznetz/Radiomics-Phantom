-Description: 
1.  This method is to compute gray-level co-ccorrence matrix(GLCM) from image inside
    the binary mask in 2.5D in 4 directions. GLCM summing occurence from all
    directions is computed also.  2.5D means:  First the occurence of individual
    intensity pair is computed in 2D slice by slice. Then, sum the occurence of individual intensity pair from all 2D image slices.
    All the feature calculation is done the same as GrayLevelCooccurenceMatrix3 does.
2.  GLCM is passed into GrayLevelCooccurenceMatrix25_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1.  Direction: Define the angle of intensity pair, 4 directions (45, 90, 180, 270).
2.  AdaptLimitLevel: If AdaptLimitLevel=1, ignore parameter GrayLimits and NumLevels. GrayLimits set to the minimum(MinValue) and
     maximum(MaxValue) of the masked image. NumLevels is length(MinValue:MaxValue).
3.   GrayLimits: Two-element vector that specifis how the grayscale values are linearly scaled into graylevels.
4.   NumLevels: Integer specifying hte number of gray-levels to use when scaling the grayscale values.
5.   Offset: The distance between the intensity pair
6.   Symmetric: 0==The pixel order in the pair matters. 1==The pixel order in the pair doesn't matter.
