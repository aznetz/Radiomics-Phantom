-Description: 
1.  This method is to compute gray-level co-ccorrence matrix(GLCM) from image inside
     the binary mask in 3D in 13 unique directions. GLCM summing occurence from all directions is computed also.
    All the feature calculation is done the same as GrayLevelCooccurenceMatrix25 does.
2.  GLCM is passed into GrayLevelCooccurenceMatrix3_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1.  %Direction: Define the angle of intensity pair (phi/theta).
   0: 0/90, 1: 90/90, 2: 0/0, 3: 45/90, 4: 135/90, 5: 90/45, 6: 90/135, 
   7: 0/45, 8: 0/135, 9: 45/54.7, 10: 135/54.7, 11: 45/125.3, 12: 135/125.3
2. GrayLimits: Two-element vector that specifis how the grayscale values are linearly scaled into graylevels.
3. NumLevels: Integer specifying hte number of gray-levels to use when scaling the grayscale values.
4. Offset: The distance between the intensity pair
5. Symmetric: 0==The pixel order in the pair matters. 1==The pixel order in the pair doesn't matter.
