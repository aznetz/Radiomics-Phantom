-Description: 
1.   This method is to fit histogram with gaussian curves.
2.   Gaussian curve information is passed into IntensityHistogram_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1. NBins:          The number of bins.
2. RangeMin:    Lower bound of bin location.
3. RangeMax:   Upper bound of bin location.
4. RangeFix:     1==The specified RangeMin and RangeMax specified are used. 0==Ignore the specified RangeMin and RangeMax, and 
                    RangeMin and RangeMax are dynamically determined by min and max of the current image.
5. OnlyUseMaxSlice:  1: Binary mask only contains the binary slice with the maximum area. 0: Use the binary mask as it is.
6. NumberOfGauss: The number of gaussian curves to be fitted.

-Revision:
2014-10-17: The method is implemented.

-Algorithm:
1. First set NumberOfGauss to 1, detect the maximum occurence position,
    use this position to set gaussian mean, gaussian amplitude, and then fit
    the gaussian curve.
2. Get the residual curve=Original curve-Gaussian curve
3. Repeat step 1 and step 2, until NumberOfGauss is reached.
