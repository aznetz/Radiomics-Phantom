-Description: 
1.  This method is to compute gray-level run length matrix(GLRLM) from image inside
    the binary mask in 2.5D in 0 and 90 degree. GLRLM summing occurence from all
    directions is computed also.  2.5D means:  First, GLRLM is computed in 2D slice by slice. 
    Then, sum the occurence of run length from all 2D image slices.
2. GLRLM is passed into GrayLevelRunLengthMatrix25_Feature.m to compute the related features.

-Parameters:
1.  Direction:   Define the run length direction. 0 and 90 degree are supported.
2.  GrayLimits:  Two-element vector that specifis how the grayscale values are linearly scaled into graylevels.
3.  NumLevels:   Integer specifying hte number of gray-levels to use when scaling the grayscale values.
